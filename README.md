Upon first opening the app, you're able to see our palette generator. Clicking the circular arrow button to the bottom right will generate a new palette.

If you want a different palette, but with some of the colors already generated, you can click a lock icon which appears on hover. These colors will remain the same as the others are replaced.

To create a new project folder, you may type in your choice of name in the first input and either hit enter or click the plus sign towards the right.
