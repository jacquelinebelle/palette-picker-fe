Upon first opening the app, you can see the palette generator as well as options to create new projects or name and save the current palette to a new project. A user is also able to generate new palettes by clicking the circular arrow button.

Clicking the "Projects" link will take you to a page that shows a list of projects you have saved. From there, you can click on one of the cards that will lead to a corresponding project page.

On this page, you can edit the project name by clicking on the title, which reveals an input. Typing a new name and pressing the enter/return key will save the new name.

Clicking on an individual palette saved to a project takes you to a page with a similar layout as the home page, but showing the name and colors specific to the chosen palette.

Here, you can change the name of your palette or generate new colors. Clicking on a lock icon (appears when hovering over specific colors) allows you to "freeze" those colors in place as you generate the colors that haven't been frozen.
